 **`Digital Learner (New Dev/Selftaught/Dreamer)`**

 I am a new dev, just trying to navigate my way through my friends conversations. Learning things has always been one of the my favorite things to do
 and what better way to do it than with coding? There is always something new to try, some new idea that just tickles my fancy. I am very new to github
 and all things that come with coding so bare with me. Enough about that, let's get to the good stuff!
